To-Do:
add to battleWin(), battleLose(), and deathCheck() (cause of death, current turn)

Transfer changes like enemies, moves, condition effects, and items when the new versions of Tweep Quest are
usable

Have the bot change the description each time we win or lose.
Skill and Luck are percentages
Make sure all player moves can also be used by enemies.
Replace duplicateprevention with DuplicatePrevention()
Add damage = math.ceil(damage) after every attack
Make a 'How To Play' guide
Make a Move Guide

Questions:
Why can't the 'improve' section use variables like Vitality or Spirit?
Should attacks really be doing that little damage?
Is there a more efficient way to process commands for different results? (Around Line 25)
How do I change the duplicate prevention number in real time?
How can the players choose the distance they want to move?
How can the players choose their moves in battle?
How do I round up numbers to be better presented?
Should there be an Accuracy mechanic in battles?
